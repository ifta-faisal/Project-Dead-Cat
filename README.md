# Project Dead Cat: DIY FPV Drone with Stability & Style

### Introduction
Welcome to the Dead Cat Drone Project! This lightweight, custom-built Dead Cat frame drone is designed for smooth, stable flights with excellent battery efficiency, giving you extended flight times. The splayed arm design minimizes propeller interference in camera footage, making it ideal for aerial videography and FPV flying. This documentation will guide you through building and optimizing the drone, making it easy to recreate or customize for your own flying experience.

### Features
- Autonomous flight
- Camera integration
- Obstacle avoidance
